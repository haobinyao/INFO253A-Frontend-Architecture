## What is HTML?
HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language" and is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.


It defines the structure of the webpage, using different elements which help the browser render the webpage into the way you actually see it.

Let's take a look at this [code](https://gist.github.com/rishabhmthakur2/10a51efe83528ef3214c4cb293f17ce4) for example! Can you guess what this is? 
<b>Hint:</b> This is something that you almost see everyday!

## How does HTML work?
As mentioned above, HTML uses something called <i>Elements</i> where each element has a different use and is treated differently by the browser.

Whenever you see a webpage, you stumble across many elements: Headings, Paragraphs, Images, Videos, Lists, Forms so on and so forth.

So a browser internally knows how a Heading is supposed to be used vs how an image is supposed to be displayed. Each of these elements also have inherent properties and functions. For example, you can hover over an image to save it, or you might have a caption. But we don't have these properties for say, a heading or a paragraph.

### An HTML element
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

```
<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
```
